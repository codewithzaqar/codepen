# CodePen-like Live Preview

This project is a simple, interactive web editor that mimics the functionality of CodePen. It allows you to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate panels and see the results in real-time in a preview pane.

## Features

- **Live Preview:** See the changes immediately in the preview pane as you type.
- **Editable Panels:** Separate panels for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Responsive Layout:** The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for a comfortable coding experience.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the editor and preview area.
- **styles.css**: The styles that create the layout and design of the editor.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript that updates the preview based on changes made in the editor panels.
